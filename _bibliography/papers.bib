abstract = {Community detection refers to the task of discovering groups of vertices sharing similar properties or functions so as to understand the network data. With the recent development of deep learning, graph representation learning techniques are also utilized for community detection. However, the communities can only be inferred by applying clustering algorithms based on learned vertex embeddings. These general cluster algorithms like K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model cannot output much overlapped communities, which have been proved to be very common in many real-world networks. In this paper, we propose CommunityGAN, a novel community detection framework that jointly solves overlapping community detection and graph representation learning. First, unlike the embedding of conventional graph representation learning algorithms where the vector entry values have no specific meanings, the embedding of CommunityGAN indicates the membership strength of vertices to communities. Second, a specifically designed Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) is adopted to optimize such embedding. Through the minimax competition between the motif-level generator and discriminator, both of them can alternatively and iteratively boost their performance and finally output a better community structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate that CommunityGAN achieves substantial community detection performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Neural networks have achieved great success in many tasks, including data classification and pattern recognition. However, how neural networks work and what representations they learn are still not fully understood. For any data sample fed into a neural network, we wondered how its corresponding vectors expanded by activated neurons change throughout the layers and why the final output vector could be classified or clustered. To formally answer these questions, we define the data sample outputs of each layer as activation vectors and the space expanded by them as the activation space. Then, we investigate the geometric structure of the high-dimensional activation spaces of neural networks by studying the geometric characters of the massive activation vectors through approximated convex hulls. We find that the different layers of neural networks have different roles, where the former and latter layers can disperse and gather data points, respectively. Moreover, we also propose a novel classification method based on the geometric structures of activation spaces, called nearest convex hull (NCH) classification, for the activation vectors in each layer of a neural network. The empirical results show that the geometric structure can indeed be utilized for classification and often outperforms original neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the relationship among the convex hulls of different classes could be a good metric to help us optimize neural networks in terms of over-fitting detection and network structure simplification.}

abstract = {The research of geoscience plays a strong role in helping people gain a better understanding of the Earth. To effectively represent the knowledge (KG) from enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means. In the face of enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means to manage the relationships of data and integrate knowledge extracted from them. However, the existing geoscience KGs mainly focus on the external connection between concepts, whereas the potential abundant information contained in the internal multimodal data of the paper is largely overlooked for more fine-grained knowledge mining. To this end, we propose GAKG, a large-scale multimodal academic KG based on 1.12 million papers published in various geoscience-related journals. In addition to the bibliometrics elements, we also extracted the internal illustrations, tables, and text information of the articles, and dig out the knowledge entities of the papers and the era and spatial attributes of the articles, coupling multimodal academic data and features. Specifically, GAKG realizes knowledge entity extraction under our proposed Human-In-the-Loop framework, the novelty of which is to combine the techniques of machine reading and information retrieval with manual annotation of geoscientists in the loop. Considering the fact that literature of geoscience often contains more abundant illustrations and time scale information compared with that of other disciplines, we extract all the geographical information and era from the geoscience papers' text and illustrations, mapping papers to the atlas and chronology. Based on GAKG, we build several knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding geoscience communities and predicting potential links. GAKG and its services have been made publicly available and user-friendly.},

abstract = {Most existing knowledge graphs (KGs) in academic domains suffer from problems of insufficient multi-relational information, name ambiguity and improper data format for large-scale machine processing. In this paper, we present AceKG, a new large-scale KG in academic domain. AceKG not only provides clean academic information, but also offers a large-scale benchmark dataset for researchers to conduct challenging data mining projects including link prediction, community detection and scholar classification. Specifically, AceKG describes 3.13 billion triples of academic facts based on a consistent ontology, including necessary properties of papers, authors, fields of study, venues and institutes, as well as the relations among them. To enrich the proposed knowledge graph, we also perform entity alignment with existing databases and rule-based inference. Based on AceKG, we conduct experiments of three typical academic data mining tasks and evaluate several state-of-the-art knowledge embedding and network representation learning approaches on the benchmark datasets built from AceKG. Finally, we discuss promising research directions that benefit from AceKG.},
